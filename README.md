# LandModETmapper
The LandMODETmapper is a Matlab based GUI for implementation of SEBAL and METRIC models on Landsat and MODIS.
Input data (and all the codes for running the models) for one sample image (one Landsat and MODIS each) for running the LandModET Mapper are available in this google drive folder https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MS5Dx5A9zmilduYKf7ugqXO7E6t2P0Am/view?usp=sharing.
